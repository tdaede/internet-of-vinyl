== Mechanical assembly ==

== 3D printed parts ==

All 3D printed parts are for fastening things down to the record player, and can be omitted if a different method of attachment is used (tape, glue).

== USB ==
Slice the adhesive holding the USB B jack down, then desolder the jack.

Cut a USB-A cable and solder the +5V, GND, D+, and D- wires to the pads or surrounding traces.

== Ethernet ==
Create an Ethernet extension cable using a two-foot Ethernet cable and a punch down connector.

Cut away the plastic bosses around the USB port to make room for the ethernet connector. Relocate any capacitors that would be in the way to the other side of the PCB by desoldering and resoldering them. Insert and glue the Ethernet jack into the 3d brinted Ethernet holder with PU glue, then affix the Ethernet jack to the wall of the player with PU glue. Insert an Ethernet cable through the case to provide tension and alignment while the glue cures.

== Power ==
Solder two wires to the mains connection on the power inlet PCB. Slide several pieces of heatshrink over each wire, then solder the other end of the wires to the Canakit Raspberry Pi power supply. Slide the heatshrink over the power supply pins and shrink it.

Screw the 3D printed frame around the power supply, and then glue the frame to the record player chassis with PU glue.

== Raspberry Pi==
Screw the Raspberry Pi to the mounting bracket, then glue the bracket to the chassis with PU glue.

== Original PCB ==
Due to the thickness of the Ethernet socket, the board may not screw down tightly on the original bosses. Use 3D printed spacers to bring the board to the proper height.

== Cable management ==
Glue or stick zip tie anchors to the chassis, and then zip tie cables to the chassis, being careful to avoid interference with any mechanical parts.
